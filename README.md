# Retail Data Management with AWS Glue

This project showcases my skills in building a complete ETL pipeline using **AWS Glue** and **Amazon S3** to process, clean, and analyze retail data. It demonstrates my ability to work with cloud-based data workflows and deliver analytical insights from raw datasets.

## üìå Project Summary

In this project, I:

* Uploaded raw product and transaction data to Amazon S3
* Created AWS Glue **classifiers**, **crawlers**, and a **Visual ETL job**
* Performed an **inner join** on `Product ID` to combine transaction and product metadata
* Used **regex** to clean currency values in the `Sales` column
* Applied an **aggregate transformation** to calculate the average net sales grouped by product category and ship mode
* Stored the final output in **Parquet format** in an S3 output bucket
* Queried the output using **S3 Select** to confirm the transformation result

## ‚úÖ Steps Performed

1. **Data Upload**

   * Uploaded `transactions.csv` to `transaction-files/` folder in an S3 bucket
   * Uploaded `product details.csv` to `product-files/` folder in the same bucket

2. **AWS Glue Setup**

   * Created a Glue database named `abc-retail`
   * Created two classifiers for reading CSV files with headers:

     * `txnClass` for `transactions.csv`
     * `cust_classifier` for `product details.csv`
   * Created two crawlers to import both datasets into the Glue Data Catalog

3. **Visual ETL Job**

   * Added Glue Data Catalog nodes for both tables
   * Joined the datasets on `Product ID` using an **Inner Join**
   * Dropped one duplicate `Product ID` column
   * Used **Regex Extractor** on `Sales` column to extract numeric values into a new column called `NetSales`
   * Applied **Aggregate** transformation:

     * Grouped by: `Product Category`, `Ship Mode`
     * Aggregated field: `NetSales`
     * Aggregation function: `Average`
   * Saved output to another S3 bucket in **Parquet format** with **Snappy compression**

4. **Result Verification**

   * Queried the `.parquet` output file using **S3 Select** with SQL:

     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM s3object
     ```
   * Confirmed correct aggregation with output:
